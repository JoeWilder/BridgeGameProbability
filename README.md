# BridgeGameProbability
Simulation for MAT-239 project 2 prompt 3

Prompt: 
Youâ€™ll analyse a bridge-crossing game. Various scenarios will be considered. In each scenario, the game is
as follows. All players begin at one end of the bridge, with the goal of getting all the way to the other side.
The bridge consists of glass panes, each of which will turn red or green when stepped on. If a player stops
on a pane and it turns red, that player is out. All lit panes remain lit for the entirety of the game (so later
players have an advantage).
Players will cross the bridge one at a time, in a predetermined order. You may also assume that the glass
panes are large enough that players may not jump over segments of the bridge. That is, in the picture below,
the players begin from the left side of the bridge and each player m

Simulation 1 scenario) The bridge contains 2 glass panes in each segment and there are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge.
That is, the bridge is like the one in the image above, but it contains 18 columns rather than just four.
Each segment contains one pane that will light green and one pane that will light red.

Simulation 2 scenario) The bridge contains 3 glass panes in each segment and there are 18 segments to cross the entire bridge.
Each segment contains two panes that will light green and one pane that will light red.

Simulation 3 scenario) The bridge contains 3 glass panes in each segment and there are 18 segments to cros
